            <!-- Friends Story -->
            <p>These are my high school friends since Form One. Honestly, I didn’t expect that we would still be close until now. Back then, we met almost every day; now we meet once or twice a month, yet our friendship has remained strong.</p>

            <p>I have a close group of female friends, as well as a larger group that includes both boys and girls. Even though in Form Three some of us were separated where some went to boarding school, others changed classes according to chosen courses our friendship stayed strong and became even more meaningful.</p>

            <p>I really appreciate their presence in my life. Whenever we meet, whether it’s a quick catch-up at Mamak or just updating each other on our lives, we sometimes throwback to school days and share memories. These moments always remind me of the fun and support we’ve had over the years.</p>
