            <!-- Family Story -->
            <p>I come from a family of six siblings, and I am the second child. My father is the only one who works, while my mother is a full-time housewife. Both of my parents have always supported me in everything I am interested in.</p>

            <p>My fifth and sixth siblings are non-identical twins, which makes our family even more special to me. This small family has been my support system since I finished secondary school and before stepping into university life.</p>

            <p>Before entering university, while waiting for my SPM results, my mother encouraged me to do a part-time job. One of the most meaningful experiences for me was when she helped me find a job right after finishing my SPM. At that time, I had to overcome my fear of communicating with people.</p>

            <p>I worked at a J&T company for five months. It was my first working experience, and I gained a lot of knowledge and life skills. Since then, during every semester break, I try to find a part-time job to fill my free time and train myself to be more disciplined and independent.</p>

            <p>After receiving good SPM results, my father gifted me a brand-new phone. It meant a lot to me because I had never owned a new phone before. I still use it today, and it always reminds me of my parents’ love and support.</p>

            <p>Through working part-time, I learned how to manage my own money. I saved my earnings to get braces, something I had wanted for a long time. I am proud of achieving it using my own effort.</p>
