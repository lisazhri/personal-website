            <!-- Sister Story -->
            <p>My sister is just two years older than me and will be 23 this New Year 2026. When we were younger, we often argued because of our different personalities. Over time, we both went to study in different places which she continued her studies at UiTM Seri Iskandar so we rarely met, only during long school or semester breaks.</p>

            <p>Whenever she comes back home, we spend time catching up and sharing stories about our lives. I feel really grateful because she is the best sister who always tries to understand me. Thanks to her, I have been trying to become a better person, as she always gives me positive advice and encouragement.</p>

            <p>Sometimes we share our thoughts and feelings openly, like a safe space to “trauma dump” as siblings. There were times we stayed up until 5 a.m. talking about everything, and after serious conversations, we would both cry and then laugh together. Those moments are some of my favorite memories with her.</p>

            <p>Sometimes I feel a little sad thinking about the future, because I cannot imagine when she gets married. We have shared so much together such as clothes, food, and even the same bed and room at times. Our bond is very close, and her presence has always been important to me.</p>
