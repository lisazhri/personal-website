            <!-- Roommate Story -->
            <p>This is my roommate since the first day of my diploma. She has shared a room with me from Semester 1 until Semester 5. Even though we faced a bit of a setback in Semester 4, when she got a room on a lower floor as an MPP, we still managed to stay in the same block. During that time, I still made it a point to meet and catch up with her, and we continue to do so until now.</p>

            <p>From the beginning until now, she has been the only person who truly knows the changes I have gone through over the semesters. Whenever I face a problem, she is always the first person willing to listen and support me. Even though we are in the same course but different classes, our bond has stayed very strong.</p>

            <p>She is also a great cook and often reminds me to eat. Sometimes we cook and share meals together, which strengthens our friendship. I feel a little sad knowing that this is our last semester together, and I wonder if we will have the chance to live like this again during our degree. Her presence has taught me independence, patience, and teamwork, and I am truly grateful to have her in my life.</p>
